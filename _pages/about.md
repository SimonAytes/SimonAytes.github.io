I am a graduate student at the KAIST Graduate School of AI in Seoul, South Korea, where I work as a researcher at the [MLAI Lab](https://www.mlai-kaist.com/) under the guidance of [Dr. Hwang Sung Ju](http://www.sungjuhwang.com/). My goal is to leverage the transformative potential of AI to address real-world challenges, advancing sustainable and ethical innovation for a better future.

## 🔍 **Research Interests**  

I am passionate about exploring cutting-edge AI topics, particularly:  
- **Efficient AI**: Optimizing large language models for reduced latency, cost-effectiveness, and computational efficiency during inference
- **In-Context and Few-Shot Learning**: Optimizing machine learning models to perform effectively with minimal data and efficient context understanding.
- **Multimodal Retrieval Systems**: Developing systems that integrate and process diverse forms of data like text, images, and audio for advanced information retrieval.  

If these areas excite you, I’d love to collaborate! Feel free to reach out: **saytes@kaist.ac.kr**.


## 🧑‍💻 **Work Experience**

I have had the privilege of working with prestigious organizations such as NASA, Columbia University, and the Wall Street Journal. My professional journey has involved diverse roles across both the private and public sectors. 

Through these experiences, I’ve cultivated a unique skill set that blends technical proficiency, innovative thinking, and a passion for addressing societal challenges through data.
