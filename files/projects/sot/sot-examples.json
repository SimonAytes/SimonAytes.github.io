If the number of poles at each intersection is 6, and the road has 4 intersections, calculate the total number of functioning street lights if 20 streetlights from the total number are not working.<think>1. First, determine the number of poles at one intersection:\n   - There are 6 poles per intersection.\n\n2. Determine the total number of poles across all intersections:\n   - The road has 4 intersections.\n   - Total number of poles = 6 poles/intersection \u00d7 4 intersections = 24 poles.\n\n3. Calculate the total number of street lights:\n   - Each pole has 4 street lights.\n   - Total street lights = 24 poles \u00d7 4 street lights/pole = 96 street lights.\n\n4. Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights to find the number of functioning street lights:\n   - There are 20 street lights that are not working.\n   - Functioning street lights = Total street lights - Non-functioning street lights = 96 - 20 = 76 street lights.\n\n5. Verification:\n   - The calculations make sense considering the number of poles, street lights, and the specified non-functioning lights.</think>/nAnswer: 76"

Let's analyze the options in the context of what happens to the body when going to sleep:\n   - A. Snoring: This is a possible occurrence during sleep for some people but is not a universal function of falling asleep.\n   - B. Latency: Refers to the time it takes to fall asleep, which is a process leading to sleep rather than a function of the body when asleep.\n   - C. Dreams: These are experiences or activities that occur during certain stages of sleep, particularly REM sleep.\n   - D. Relaxation: The body generally relaxes as it transitions to sleep, with a decrease in heart rate and muscle activity.\n   - E. Dreaming: Similar to C, this involves experiencing dreams, which occur during sleep.\n\n2. The question specifically asks what happens to the body when going to sleep, implying the general physiological changes.\n3. The most universal and immediate physiological change when going to sleep is the relaxation of the body as it prepares for and enters a state of rest.\n4.

The main question is whether appendiceal perforation is a risk factor for tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy.\n\n2. Let's evaluate the information provided:\n   - Twenty-three studies were considered, but only four had original data and comparison groups, which is a small sample size.\n   - The reported risk estimates:\n     - Ectopic pregnancy after appendectomy: Risk estimate of 1.6 (95% CI 1.1 to 2.5)\n     - Tubal infertility from appendiceal perforation: Risk estimate of 4.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 14.9)\n\n3. A confidence interval that does not include 1 suggests a statistically significant increased risk:\n   - Ectopic pregnancy: CI is 1.1 to 2.5, indicating significance.\n   - Tubal infertility: CI is 1.5 to 14.9, indicating significance.\n\n4. The studies have limitations such as recall bias and poor adjustment for confounding variables, which could weaken the conclusions.\n\n5. Despite the limitations, the evidence suggests that appendiceal perforation is associated with an increased risk for both tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy.\n\n6. Given the significant risk estimates, but also considering the study limitations, the evidence leans towards \"Yes,\" perforation of the appendix is a risk factor for these conditions, albeit with some noted limitations affecting the strength of this conclusion.</think>/nAnswer: Yes"
